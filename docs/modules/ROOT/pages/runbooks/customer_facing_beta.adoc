== Cluster Ingress

This SLI is a combination of the xref:ingress.adoc#canary[Ingress Canary] and OpenShift Ingress HAProxy metrics.

Every three minutes without a successful canary request and without a successful request to customer ingress backends is counted to the error budget.

See xref:ingress.adoc[] for all debugging information.
