There are two types of alerts that fire if we expect to miss the configured objective.

* A ticket alert means that the error rate is slightly higher than the objective.
If we don't intervene at some point after receiving this alert, we can expect to miss the objective.
However no immediate, urgent action is necessary.
A ticket alert should have a label `severity: warning`.
* A page alert means that the error rate is significantly higher than the objective.
Immediate action is necessary to not miss the objective.
A page alert should have a label `severity: critical` and should page on-call.
